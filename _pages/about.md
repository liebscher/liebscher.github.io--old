I am a research assistant with [BetterUp](https://www.betterup.com/), with a special interest in natural language processing. I recently graduated from the University of California: San Diego, where I studied Cognitive Science and Mathematics and researched metaphor's impact on behavior under [Ben Bergen](http://www.cogsci.ucsd.edu/~bkbergen/) and [Sean Trott](https://seantrott.github.io/). I strive to contribute to the development of human-centered, data-driven technologies. I'm most inspired at the intersection of elegant statistics and messy human behavior, especially surrounding language and music. I also enjoy staying fit, reading, backpacking, and gardening. For an explanation of my blog's title, [see here](blog/2020/blog-origins/).
