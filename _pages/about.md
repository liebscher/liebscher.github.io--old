I am a Jr. Computational Social Scientist at [BetterUp](https://www.betterup.com/). Here I'm studying mechanisms of positive communication, and physical and mental wellbeing. I graduated from the University of California: San Diego, where I studied Cognitive Science and Mathematics and researched metaphor's impact on behavior under [Ben Bergen](http://www.cogsci.ucsd.edu/~bkbergen/) and [Sean Trott](https://seantrott.github.io/). My passions lie at the intersection of statistics and human behavior, where I can contribute to the development of human-centered, data-driven technologies that positively impact people. I also enjoy staying fit, reading, backpacking, and gardening. For an explanation of my blog's title, [see here](blog/2020/blog-origins/).
