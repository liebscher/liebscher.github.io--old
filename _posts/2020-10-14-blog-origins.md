The blog title and subtitle might not sounds... correct. Your gut is correct, they were not written by me. They were [composed by GPT-2](https://transformer.huggingface.co/doc/gpt2-large){:target="_blank"} according to a prompt:

<div class="row mt-3">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        <img class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/blog-origins.png">
    </div>
</div>
<br/>

I cherry-picked a little to find something which somewhat made sense and reflected a general aura of intelligence, and then made one character correction. Please excuse the typo in my prompt.
